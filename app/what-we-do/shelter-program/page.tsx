            provide a stable family environment and whole-life care for indigent and vulnerable
            children. The term Whole life care means we take a long-term approach to child
            development and provide opportunities that champion childrenâ€™s right to a safe,
            permanent and nurturing home thus encouraging healthy, spiritual, physical, social and
            economic development for indigent, vulnerable and orphaned children in our direct care
            all the way through young adulthood.

            We support other Child care institutions that provide holistic child development for

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            This is because many orphanages and child care institutions are overpopulated and with
            limited cash inflow, they struggle to meet the individual needs of the children in their
            care. Through this initiative, we provide support for the children they serve.
